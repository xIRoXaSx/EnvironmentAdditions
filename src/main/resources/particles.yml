Particles:
  Snow:
    # The type of the particle. Have a look at the link above for all available particles.
    Particle: FIREWORKS_SPARK
    # Some particles can be colored (e.g. REDSTONE), you can define the color as a hex code here.
    RedstoneHexColor: '#55ffff'
    # Some particles can be resized (e.g. REDSTONE), you can define the size of those particles here.
    RedstoneSize: 10
    # The amount of particles. If greater than 0, the particles will fly more aggressively.
    ParticleCount: 0
    Animation:
      # If you want to spawn "Static" particles, and you don't know the direction a player faces, you can set the relative distance here.
      # Otherwise, you can use relative options down below.
      ViewDirectionDistance: 0
      # The relative x location the particles will spawn at.
      RelativeOffsetX: 0
      # The relative y location the particles will spawn at.
      RelativeOffsetY: 5
      # The relative z location the particles will spawn at.
      RelativeOffsetZ: 0
      LoopOption:
        # Can either be "Disabled", "Static", "Cubic" or "Random".
        # Example "Static": The configured particle(s) will spawn at the current location of the player.
        #    According to the set direction modifiers (ViewDirectionDistance, RelativeOffsetX, ...), the spawned location
        #    will be modified.
        # Example "Cubic": A cubic area around the player will be calculated in which particle will spawn
        #    (more calculation needed as for "Random" and does not look as randomized).
        # Example "Random": Random locations around the player ('RadiusInBlocks' at each axis, maximum) will be picked.
        Type: Random
        # The max area size of the particles ("Cubic" or "Random").
        # Example (Type "Cubic"): Setting this to 5 will pick a location in a 5x5x5 cubic area.
        # Example (Type "Random"): Setting this to 5 will pick random numbers between -5 and 5 for X, Y and Z to spawn the particle.
        RadiusInBlocks: 30
        # Example (Type "Cubic"): Setting this higher than 1 will skip some particles of the calculated "cube".
        #    This is an option to "randomize" particle spawns around the player.
        # Example (Type "Random"): If "Random" is used, this will be used to indicate HOW MANY particles should
        #    be spawned in total!
        ChanceForEachLoop: 5
    # An optional condition, leave empty if no condition should be used.
    # Keep in mind, all conditions need to apply before any linked operation will be performed!
