Particles:
  # A mapping of particle objects to play every defined PositionChecksInTicks.
  Snow:
    # The type of the particle. Have a look at the top description for all available particles
    Particle: FIREWORKS_SPARK
    # If particle is set to REDSTONE, you can define the color as a hex code here
    RedstoneHexColor: '#55ffff'
    # If particle is set to REDSTONE, you can define the size of those particles here
    RedstoneSize: 10
    # The amount of particles. If greater than 0, the particles will fly more aggressively
    ParticleCount: 0
    # If you want to set an offset to the particles, you can define the distance here.
    Animation:
      # If you don't know the direction a player faces, you can set the relative distance here.
      # Otherwise, you can use relative options down below.
      ViewDirectionDistance: 0
      # The relative x location the particles will spawn
      RelativeOffsetX: 0
      # The relative y location the particles will spawn
      RelativeOffsetY: 5
      # The relative z location the particles will spawn
      RelativeOffsetZ: 0
      # If you want to have an area filled with particles, here are some settings for it
      LoopOption:
        # Can either be Disabled, Static, Cubic or Random.
        # Example Static: The configured particle(s) will spawn at the current location of the player.
        #    According to the set direction modifiers (ViewDirectionDistance, RelativeOffsetX, ...), the spawned location
        #    will be modified.
        # Example Cubic: A cubic area around the player will be calculated in which particle will spawn
        #    (more calculation needed as option 2 and does not look as randomized as option 2).
        # Example Random: Random locations around the player ('RadiusInBlocks' at max each axis) will be picked.
        #    'ChanceForEachLoop' will be used to tell how many PARTICLES should be spawned in each loop.
        Type: Random
        # Setting this greater than 0 will calculate a cube around the player in the dimensions of the configured integer.
        # Formula for one line: x * 2 + 1
        # Example (Type Cubic): Setting this to 1 will spawn a 3x3x3 cube in total (+1 each side, relative of players location).
        # Example (Type Cubic): Setting this to 5 will spawn 11x11x11
        # Example (Type Random): Setting this to 1 will pick a random number between -1 and 1 to spawn the particle
        # Example (Type Random): Setting this to 5 will pick a random number between -5 and 5 to spawn the particle
        RadiusInBlocks: 30
        # Example (Type 1): Setting this higher than 1 will skip some particles of the "cube".
        #    This is an option to "randomize" particle spawns around the player (e.g. for snowflakes, ect)
        # Example (Type 2): If Type 2 is used, this will be used to indicate how many particles should
        #    be spawned in total! THIS IS NOT THE CHANCE IF VERSION 2 IS PICKED!
        ChanceForEachLoop: 5
    # An optional condition, leave empty if no condition should be used.
    # Keep in mind, that all conditions of the BIOME GROUP MUST ALSO APPLY!
    Condition: WhileClearAndDay
