#   Biomes can be grouped into a bundle and used in the main configuration.
#   All biomes (vanilla and custom ones) can be used.
#   A list of all vanilla biomes can be found here:
#     => https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html
#
#    You want to ditch Minecraft's vanilla biomes and have custom ones?
#    Make use of the PlaceholderAPI integration and have a look at the Placeholder description!
