      #         It will act as an indicator for ceilings.
      #         The maximum value (15) can only be achieved when a player doesn't stand under blocks, (no matter the distance).
      #         One block above the player will reduce the level to 14, a 3x3 area to 13, ...
      #         The only exceptions are (stained) glass blocks, tinted glass counts as solid.
      #         "Block" will only count the light emitted from blocks.
      #         "Generic" will count any light source.
