    # The light level at the player's position.
    LightLevel:

      # TIP:    Use the F3 menu to check the current client light.
      # NOTICE: Using "Sky" WILL NOT measure the current light level coming from the sun!
      #         It will act as an indicator for ceilings.
      #         The maximum value (15) can only be achieved when a player doesn't stand under blocks, (no matter the distance).
      #         One block above the player will reduce the level to 14, a 3x3 area to 13, ...
      #         The only exceptions are (stained) glass blocks, tinted glass counts as solid.
      #         "Block" will only count the light emitted from blocks.
      #         "Generic" will count any light source.
      #          Have a look at this wiki for further information: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Light
