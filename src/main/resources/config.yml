#
# Placeholders:
#
#    This plugin is capable of PlaceholderAPI (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) placeholders!
#    If you want to use PlaceholderAPI placeholders for biomes (certain world generators hook into PAPI for custom biomes),
#       you can set the placeholder of your choice in Settings.PapiBiomePlaceholder.
#    E.g.: '%player_biome%' will use the placeholder from the PAPI Extension "Player".
#    YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE CORRESPONDING EXTENSION INSTALLED IF USED!
#

#
# Internal placeholder:
#    If you don't want to use PlaceholderAPI, you can use these placeholders instead!
#
#    Placeholders:
#       - %world%    => [String] The world of the player
#       - %biome%    => [String] The biome of the player
#       - %x%        => [String] The x coordinates of the player
#       - %y%        => [String] The y coordinates of the player
#       - %z%        => [String] The z coordinates of the player
