# Bring your own resource - custom sounds and biomes:
#
#    If you want to use custom sounds, you can just go ahead and use the full name (including the namespace).
#    You want to ditch Minecraft's vanilla biomes and have custom ones?
#    Make use of the PlaceholderAPI integration and have a look at the Placeholder description below!
#

#
# Placeholders:
#
#    This plugin is capable of PlaceholderAPI (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) placeholders!
#    If you want to use PlaceholderAPI placeholders for biomes (certain world generators hook into PAPI for custom biomes),
#       you can set the placeholder of your choice in Settings.PapiBiomePlaceholder.
#    E.g.: '%player_biome%' will use the placeholder from the PAPI Extension "Player".
#    YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE CORRESPONDING EXTENSION INSTALLED IF NEEDED!
#

#
# Internal placeholder:
#    If you don't want to use PlaceholderAPI, you can use these placeholders instead!
#
#    Placeholders:
#       - %world%    => [String] The world in which the treasure spawned
#       - %x%        => [String] The x coordinates of the treasure
#       - %y%        => [String] The y coordinates of the treasure
#       - %z%        => [String] The z coordinates of the treasure
#       - %player%   => [String] The players' name
#

#
# Color Codes:
#    For commands you can also use color and hex codes (long and short version) like:
#       Color codes: &a - &f, &0 - &9, &k - &o, &r
#       Hex codes:   {#123456}, {#123}
